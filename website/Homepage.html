      <h1>ANNAPURNA HOTEL</h1>
      <p>A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis.
        Facilities provided inside a hotel room may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, 
        higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flat screen television, and 
        en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities.
